- no_stars: no stars are simulated (flux set to 0)

## mdet

- median_color: PSFs evaluated at the median galaxy color (i.e., the color used for the mdet catalogs)
- grid-median_color: galaxies placed on a grid with PSFs evaluated at the median galaxy color

## bfd

- grid: galaxies placed on a grid
